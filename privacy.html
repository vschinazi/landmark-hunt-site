<h1>Privacy Policy – Landmark Hunt</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 16, 2025</p>

<p><strong>Landmark Hunt</strong> is a research-driven mobile application developed to support scientific investigations into human spatial memory and navigation behavior. This Privacy Policy describes what data we collect, how it is used and stored, and your rights regarding that data.</p>

<p>This app is used exclusively within ethically approved research studies. Only individuals who have provided informed consent and have been approved through a secure whitelist system are permitted to access the app. The research protocol has been approved by the <strong>Bond University Human Research Ethics Committee</strong> under approval number <strong>VS3002</strong>.</p>

<h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>

<p>To support app functionality and enable research, the app may collect the following types of data:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Email address</strong> – Collected via Sign in with Apple and used solely for secure authentication and access control.</li>
  <li><strong>User ID</strong> – A pseudonymous identifier automatically assigned to each user and stored with session-level task data. This ID is never linked to your email.</li>
  <li><strong>Photos and labels</strong> – The core interaction of the app involves capturing photos of real-world landmarks and optionally assigning labels. These photos are stored only on your device and are never uploaded or transmitted to the research team.</li>
  <li><strong>Precise location data</strong> – If permission is granted, location coordinates are saved with each landmark and used to support navigation tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Gameplay and interaction data</strong> – This includes performance data from pointing, mapping, and distance estimation tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Usage data</strong> – Includes timestamps, session activity, number of completed tasks, deleted landmarks, and app usage frequency.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>

<p>Data collected through Landmark Hunt is used for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>App functionality</strong> – To support key features such as saving landmarks, delivering reminders, enabling navigation tasks, and saving personal progress.</li>
  <li><strong>Research</strong> – To analyze anonymized spatial behavior and cognitive task performance for scientific purposes.</li>
  <li><strong>Authentication</strong> – Email is used solely to authenticate users via Apple Sign-In and to control access through a secure whitelist system.</li>
  <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong> – Email addresses and research data are stored separately. Uploaded data does not include any personal identifiers or images.</li>
</ul>

<p>Data is not used for advertising, profiling, or commercial analytics. No data is sold or shared with third parties outside the authorized research team.</p>

<h2>3. Storage and Upload</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Data is stored locally on your device in structured JSON format.</li>
  <li>If enabled, the app will periodically upload new task data to a secure research server hosted on Supabase. Uploads occur automatically every three days when the app is launched.</li>
  <li>Photos are excluded from uploads and remain on your device only.</li>
  <li>Uploaded files are small (typically 10–200 KB) and contain only non-identifiable research data.</li>
  <li>All uploads are encrypted in transit and linked only to the pseudonymous user ID.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Permissions</h2>

<p>The app may request access to the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Camera</strong> – To allow users to capture landmark photos.</li>
  <li><strong>Location</strong> – To store the location of landmarks and support navigation tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Notifications</strong> – To deliver personalized reminders related to spatial tasks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Permissions are requested only when needed and can be managed through your device settings.</p>

<h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>

<p>Participants retain full control over their data. You may:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Disable periodic uploads at any time within the app.</li>
  <li>Reset or delete your data through the app’s admin interface.</li>
  <li>Uninstall the app to remove all locally stored data.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you withdraw from the study, your access will be revoked and your data excluded from further analysis where possible.</p>
